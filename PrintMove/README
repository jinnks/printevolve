1. Clone the repository.
2. Insert the following lines into your .bashrc
	PERL5LIB=$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5
	PATH=$PATH:$HOME/perl5/bin
	eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"
3. Move the PrintMove dir, perl5 dir and the Printmove.db in your home directory.
4. Run script/printmove_server.pl to test the application.

Ideas about email jobs:
1. create a separate application Daemon which reads the emails_job directory every 5 minutes we can use AE::Timer
2. We should look into sending the emails in batches.
3. Create a new subtask/process for each batch so that we can make use of available CPU once we have read the emails_job directory.

Improvements for this package:
1. common code could be moved into separate libraries used by both controllers.
2. We can make use of chained attributes to dispatch different user events.
